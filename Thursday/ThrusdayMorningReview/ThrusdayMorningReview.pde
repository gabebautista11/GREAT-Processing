//Lets have the students write out the awnsers on there computer first so that they can struggle a little bit

//lets do this for the first 30ish minutes of the class?


String[] food = {"Pizza", "Ice Cream", "Chicken", "Salad", "Sandwich"};


//what INDEX in the array is Chicken?

//how can I read each food in the array 1 at a time

//how can we loop through each food but only print the 2nd and 5th item in the array


int foo(int a, int b) //what does this method do?
{
 return a + b; 
}

//how can i call the above function if I want to add 10 and 25 together


//make a method 
//return type string
//2 if statments
//if random number is 0 then return "hello"
//if random number is 1 then return "world"
//Call this method inside of a print statment



//Make a while loop that skips every other number AKA goes up by 2
